## Transparency - Why it's important

One of the biggest things that erodes a community is staff that does not work _for_ the community, and the best way for staff to operate on behalf of the community is for them to be able to be held accountable by the community. Therefore it's very important that our community is as transparent as is within reason (mostly only foregoing transparency when the health, safety or reasonable privacy of a member would be otherwise violated.)

## Finances

Devanooga currently keeps a running YAML dump of all transactions over on the meta repo located here: https://github.com/devanooga/devanooga-meta/tree/master/accounting/finances

## Staff

Moderation actions are logged in our administrative actions logged here: https://github.com/devanooga/devanooga-meta/blob/master/administration/administrative-actions.md

Disputes for staff actions can be found here: https://github.com/devanooga/devanooga-meta/tree/master/administration/disputes

## Community Discussions

Discussions about changes in the community will be centered in the `devanooga-meta` channel or in the Devanooga discussion board located [here](https://github.com/devanooga/devanooga-meta/discussions).

## Donations

As per our [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct), donations above the threshold will be publicly listed in our finance YAML dump, be aware of this prior to your donations because we will do this by default, if you have any questions feel free to reach out to staff.
